Warlock clone

This project aims to replicate Warlock, Master of the Arcane with a focus on multiplayer balancing of spells and resources.

Warlock introduces some great concepts that would make it great if not for it's faults in AI and balance.

Pro:

  Dens provide a source of income to fuel the players economy early game and respawns help to infuse resources later on that 
  can help a struggling player catch up.
  
  Unit leveling continues to the point where it feel effectively limitless.
  
Cons:

  To make up for lackluster AI the devs have opted to supercharge monster units such as the dremer to make them a challenge.
  To compensate spells are made ultra powerful to handle them. In multiplayer this causes magic and mana to dominate the battlefield.
  Thousands of gold and hundreds of turns of build time and xp can be wiped out in a single casting and a few hundred mana.
